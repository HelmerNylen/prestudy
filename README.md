# Degree Project Prestudy
The code for the experimental part of the prestudy for my degree project, where five types of classifiers are tested on noisy speech. Please refer to `TODO: article link` for details.

Relies on [https://github.com/FirstHandScientist/genhmm](https://github.com/FirstHandScientist/genhmm) for the GenHMM and GMMHMM implementations (which in turn requires PyTorch, CUDA, etc.), and Matlab and the [Audio Degradation Toolbox](https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/audio-degradation-toolbox) for dataset generation. Noise samples are included but not the TIMIT database.

## Some pretty graphs
`TODO`
